The `CodeEditorView` Swift package provides a SwiftUI view implementing a rich code editor for iOS and macOS whose visual style is inspired by Xcode. The currently supported functionality includes syntax highlighting with configurable themes, inline message (warnings, errors, etc) reporting, bracket matching, matching bracket insertion, current line highlighting, and a minimap.

**Update:**

* I am currently porting `CodeEditorView` over to TextKit 2. You find the ongoing progress on `main`.
* The main work is done, which (among other things) results in performance improvements and additional functionality on iOS (line highlights and minimap).
* There are still some problems, though. On iOS, redrawing of the gutter and the minimap is broken. And on macOS, text editing performance on larger files is bad. These issues are going to be fixed next.
* The TextKit 2 implementation requires the latest versions of macOS (14) and iOS (17). If want to use `CodeEditorView` on earlier version of macOS or iOS, you need to use release 0.12.0 or the `textkit1` branch of this repository. (I don't have the bandwidth to support TextKit 2 on earlier OS versions, but I am happy to accept PRs that add support for it. They need to use Swift 5.9, though.)

## Screenshots of the demo app

This is the default dark theme on macOS. Like in Xcode, messages have got an inline view on the right-hand side of the screen, which pops up into a larger overlay to display more information. The minimap on the right provides an outline of the edited text.

The following is the default light theme on iOS. Both line highlighting and the minimap are currently not supported on iOS due to limitations in the iOS version of TextKit. Instead of the line highlight, both the current line (or the current selection range) and lines with messages are indicated with differently coloured line numbers in the gutter.

## How to use it

Typical usage of the view is as follows.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
  @State private var text:     String                    = "My awesome code..."
  @State private var position: CodeEditor.Position       = CodeEditor.Position()
  @State private var messages: Set<TextLocated<Message>> = Set()

  @Environment(\.colorScheme) private var colorScheme: ColorScheme

  var body: some View {
    CodeEditor(text: $text, position: $position, messages: $messages, language: .swift)
      .environment(\.codeEditorTheme,
                   colorScheme == .dark ? Theme.defaultDark : Theme.defaultLight)
  }
}
```

## Status

I consider this to be pre-release quality. It is sufficient to start building something on it, but it is not yet ready for production. While the `CodeEditor` view already supports quite a bit of advanced functionality (such as the inline messages and minimap), other components are still quite simple, such as the range of tokens covered by the language configuration. Moreover, performance is still an issue that needs to be addressed. The core architecture, such as the incremental tokenisation for syntax highlighting, is designed to handle larger files smoothly, but the overall implementation still needs some performance debugging.
